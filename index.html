									<h2>About</h2>
									<p>WiseGuy was orginally going to be a bitcoin bot.<br />
									His "Delta" version was named cashbot.</p>
								</header>
								<p class="content">Last spring, a group of my friends and I were just transitioning to discord from curse. One of the first things that the server admin did was add a bot to the server. The bot made the discord experience phenominally fun, and no one had a second thought about the transition. Over time many things happened and to put it simply what happened was the death of a piece of software that made a lot of us laugh, and entertained us all, so I set out to make a bot. Initally it was for fun, but then I got serious about developing my bot, named 'cashbot', with the intent of a multipurpose bot and a focus on bitcoin trading features. But overtime I realized I wasn't so much interested in developing my own bot, as I was trying to see if I could emulate that original bot we had. Eventually I hit development walls there weren't erroneous coding decisions, as much as they were a blatant breaking of ToS that the previous bot must have done. Unless I was missing something. At any rate, I decided I wanted to publish the bot I had made and try to make it something of value, and so WiseGuy wwas born. WiseGuy for me as a project is a way to put out the very little work I've done, and to add features that I think are neat or useful as Ifind more things I'd like the bot to do. If you have any features you think you would like for you server, to add to WiseGuy, feel free to contact me, and I'll see what I can do.</p>

							<h2>Inspiration from the underground</h2>
							<p>WiseGuy was inspired from an old friend, Swag Bot. In a galaxy far far away, in a time long long ago, the illuminati extended it's tendrils with a humble offering. A bot with swag beyond compare. It's a tale of adventure, yogurt, chess, memes, anger, fear, and redemption.</p>
