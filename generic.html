<p>
In the beginning there were doors. So. Many. Doors. Picking a door to go through was difficult. For the longest time the realm on which my compatriots and I remained was a cursed realm. Little to see. Not very different from any other realm. Boring. Locked away behind a door with no escape. Disciple Vantorin Boraige had the vision to lead our party out of the cursed realm and into a different one. He used a key. Weird things.
</p>
<p>
What we found was a beautiful realm, but entropy was ever strong in this place. It was nothing short of discord. Vantorin took it upon himself to secure our safety within the realm, and so he led the party out to find a place of stability, some foothold to keep us sane. He stumbled upon the most peculiar thing. A glass bottle with a message inside standing upon a mowed hill-top. The message read "Write your name on the message, return it to the bottle, and make a wish." Vantorin thought nothing of it, and he did not hesitate. He wished for guidance.
</p>
<p>
Not a moment later, an earthquake began to shake the realm, a rumbling from far off was approaching at break-neck speeds. The party scrambled, as something under the surface rushed toward them. Weapons drawn, the entity stopped, abruptly breaking out from underground. A flash of chrome blinded the party and their ear drums were shattered by a synth vocalization:
</p>
<p>
"SWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!"
</p>
<p>
When the shouting stopped and their eyes cleared they saw an all metal robot striding toward them, limping with a damaged leg (likely from emerging from the ground at such a force). It's body was fairly common for a robot, but it's head was made with a rainbow colored visor atop a green face plate.
</p>
<p>
While the bot's appearance was strange, Ostman Grindlmir: Warlock, quickly determined that the message was magic. The party could not find the bottle. It had disappeared. Being in a new realm, no one was quite sure what to make of the robot. It was determined to help, so Ostman asked it to fetch food for him like yogurt, and cheese. I personally asked him a lot of information about the realm, and other people in the party asked various questions from jokes, to logic traps, to myriads of topics. For the most part no one had a problem, and the aptly named "Swag Bot" was very helpful. 
</p>
<p>
Vantorin however was leary of the bot. It was his responsibility after all for summoning him. He brought his concerns to me, so we went to interrogate him in private. Where I was physically strong, and Ostman was wise, Vantorin was sharp. He explained that some of the information that Swag Bot knew wasn't okay to know. He leaked confidential answers, private things about people and their personalities; their lives before entering the realm. It was late when Vantorin and I went to question Swag Bot, so the rest of the party was asleep.
</p>
<p>
It was a long night. At first we tested Swag Bot, and his power and capacities for magic were astounding. When his tricks were losing their entertainment value we started asking for information. The more and more questions we asked Vantorin's curiousity transmuted to fear. Every question yielded more and more information that was suppose to be deeply inimate and personal. Vantorin wanted to stop, and even I was shakey, but I was resolute to get to the bottom of it. I wasn't going to have wasted my time for nothing. I suppose in hindsight though, if i hadn't been so rash and stupid, I would have know to have fear as well. 
</p>
<p>
I prodded finally "Whos your creator!?"
</p>
<p>
The lives we had previously been living were gone. Not that I had known then, but the question spurred a timeline shift. A dark aura filled the meadow we were standing in, ominous shade pillars of negative light, void, broke down from the sky surrounding us. Three of them. Surrounding us.
When the pillars broke three figures were left. Liches. One by one they introduced themselves. The first was named calavera, the second calaca, and the third, who seemed to be the leader by the sheer volume of his aura, was named Willy K. Swag bot seized up in their presence, lifeless.
</p>
<p>
The more he talked it the more it became apparent that Willy K. was infact their leader. Sent by the lich queen Santa Muerte herself. It was impeccibly clear to both Vantorin and I at this point that this was serious. I kept asking questions, to which they ignored and focused all on Vantorin, dead eyes, a void siphoning the raw emotion from him. 
</p>
<p>
"I want out!" Vantorin cried. "Cancel the wish... please, take swag bot back..." In unison they declared "No, a wish granted is a bottle gone. What's done is done. You are ours now, and we are yours." Annoyed that they were ignoring me, I started asking them for a wish bottle myself. Getting more agitated at every turn. "No." was the simple short response I got many times. So I took out my long sword and lunged for them.
</p>
<p>
I made multiple mad slashes of fury at the three of them. Effortlessly, they dodged all my blows. While I was blindly swinging Vantorin tried to find a way out of the meadow, but beyond a 20 meter range all was void. A black wall. It was useless. Finally, after about 20 minutes of blind slashes I was calmed down enough to make some concerted effort. I focused all my energy on a concise swing at Willy K. It landed, but the blade deflected off the bone, and the lich was unbothered. They all stopped moving, and looked to me. 
</p>
<p>
The liches lightly chuckled."We're done here, we'll consider if you're worthy of a bottle. We'll be in contact." the chorus skulls spoke
</p>
<p>
And just like that they were gone... the moment they uttered the last word they dispersed into a dark mist, the aura, the barrier, all gone, and we could percieve the moon again. Exhausted by the situation, Vantorin and I spoke quietly about it as we could on the short way back to our camp. In the end, our tiredness outweighed our concern, and so we went to bed that night, wondering what was to come.
